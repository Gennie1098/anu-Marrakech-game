declaration: >-
  I submit the work below for assessment as my best work. I declare that this
  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:


# I wish to submit the following classes as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit methods):
class:
  -
  -

    # I wish to submit the following methods as entirely my own (remove this if
  # you want to just submit classes):
method: playerInfo() & createPlayerRectangle()
  - Pretty happy with how these turned out as these were pretty much the first parts of the viewer I did and they put me
  - on a roll essentially. Although they don't look too amazing, it definitely helped me get the assignment finished
  - quicker.

method:
  - fair amount of displayState()
  - Although I will admit it's a bit hectic within it, I feel pretty good about how I did it and got everything working
  - together.
